Import necessary libraries: Imports Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy, and psycopg2 for data manipulation, visualization, and database interaction.
Connect to PostgreSQL: The connect_to_postgresql function remains unchanged, establishing a connection to the database.
Read data from table: The read_data_from_table function remains unchanged, retrieving data from the specified table and returning it as a Pandas DataFrame.
Visualize data: The visualize_data function now converts the DataFrame columns to NumPy arrays before plotting. This can potentially improve performance for large datasets. The rest of the function remains the same, creating the desired visualization based on the chart type and column selections.
Main function: The main function remains unchanged, handling the overall execution and calling the other functions.
